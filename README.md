# Jipy (JSON In-Place)

A Chrome Extension that allows you to format JSON in browser. Unlike other formatters, Jipy does not rely on the whole page being return as JSON. Jipy works by let you choose the portion of text that you want to format. This enables you to format any embeded JSON.

# Usage
1. Highlight portion you want to format (whole or partial)
2. Format
    - Use hotkey (Alt+F)
    - Use context menu (Right-Click > `Format JSON`)
    - Use extension button (located at top right corner)

# Note
Jipy will perform JSON extraction when the highlight portion is not a valid JSON.
